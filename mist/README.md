# [IBM PC/XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT)  [DeMiSTified](https://github.com/robinsonb5/DeMiSTify)  - MIST port

24/09/22 MIST port DeMiSTified by Somhic from original MiSTer PCXT core  https://github.com/spark2k06/PCXT_MiSTer

[Read this guide if you want to know how I DeMiSTified this core](https://github.com/DECAfpga/DECA_board/tree/main/Tutorials/DeMiSTify).

### STATUS

* **UART port is required to be used to load the OS through the serdrive app.**


**Bugs**:

* With original IBM ROM  keyboard might not work very well.

* Serdrive works at 460.8 K or 230.4K but not 115.2K

  

### Compile the project in Quartus:

Project already has the Demistify firmware already generated so if you have cloned recursively then you can open the project with Quartus:

```sh
git clone  --recursive https://github.com/somhi/PCXT_DeMiSTify

#Load project in Quartus from /PCXT.qpf
```



### OSD Controls

* F12 show/hide OSD 
* Long F12 toggles VGA/RGB mode
* The reset button KEY0 resets the controller (so re-initialises the SD card if it's been changed, reloads any autoboot ROM.) The OSD Reset menu item resets the core itself.
