# [IBM PC/XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT)  [DeMiSTified](https://github.com/robinsonb5/DeMiSTify)  - SIDI port

07/07/22 SIDI port DeMiSTified by Somhic from original MiSTer PCXT core  https://github.com/spark2k06/PCXT_MiSTer

[Read this guide if you want to know how I DeMiSTified this core](https://github.com/DECAfpga/DECA_board/tree/main/Tutorials/DeMiSTify).

### STATUS

* Open OSD with F12 key. Go to Video and change to MDA ouput. Then Load ROMs and Reset.
* CGA not implemented due to lack of BRAM in this board.
* **UART port is required to be used to load the OS through the serdrive app.**

**Bugs**:

* With original IBM ROM  keyboard might not work very well.

* Serdrive works at 460.8 K or 230.4K but not 115.2K

  

### Compile the project in Quartus:

Project already has the Demistify firmware already generated so if you have cloned recursively then you can open the project with Quartus:

```sh
git clone  --recursive https://github.com/somhi/PCXT_DeMiSTify

#Load project in Quartus from /sidi/PCXT_sidi.qpf
```



### Instructions to Full compile the project for a specific board:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/somhi/PCXT_DeMiSTify
cd PCXT_DeMiSTify
#Do a first make (will finish in error) but it will download missing submodules 
make
cd DeMiSTify
#Create file site.mk in DeMiSTify folder 
cp site.template site.mk
#Edit site.mk and add your own PATHs to Quartus (Q18)
gedit site.mk
#Go back to root folder and do a make with board target (deca, neptuno, uareloaded, atlas_cyc). If not specified it will compile for all targets.
cd ..
make BOARD=sidi
#when asked just accept default settings with Enter key
```

After that you can:

* Load project in Quartus from /sidi/PCXT_sidi.qpf



### OSD Controls

* F12 show/hide OSD 
* Long F12 toggles VGA/RGB mode
* The reset button KEY0 resets the controller (so re-initialises the SD card if it's been changed, reloads any autoboot ROM.) The OSD Reset menu item resets the core itself.
