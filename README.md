Port DeMiSTified by @somhi from original MiSTer port currently in development  https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/PCXT_MiSTer

[Read this guide if you want to know how I DeMiSTified this core](https://github.com/DECAfpga/DECA_board/tree/main/Tutorials/DeMiSTify).

Follow PCXT core discussion at https://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?t=4680

**Status**: 

* Work in progress
* Check [Bugs and TODO list](TODO.md)
* Check specific BOARD limitations on each board folder's readme

**Loading OS**:

Currently floppy and hdd images can only be loaded trough serial UART Rx/Tx with the XT IDE BIOS. Serdrive program should be used in the host computer serving the images.

```sh
#Windows example
serdrive.exe -g 733:7:17 -v [-c <port>] -d 460.8Kb <image>
#Linux example
serdrive_x64 -g 733:7:17 -v -c /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 921.6K PCXT_CGA_Tandy.img 
```

Some notes about serdrive:

* 115.2 kbps does not work
* 921.6 kbps only works at 14.3 MHz
* Core has enabled RTS/CTS signals which gives better stability and speed to the HDD
  * Windows does not care about RTS/CTS signals
  * In Linux those RTS/CTS lines need to be connected for XTIDE to detect the image. Take care that CTS goes to RTS and RTS to CTS.

**Composite CGA video output**: 

CGA mode has available composite video output:

* Through green pin of the DB15 VGA connector
* Simultaneous output through 1 GPIO pin

Just add 1 resistor in series of 180 Ohm (could be 220) between the FPGA composite output pin and the TV composite input central pin.

# [IBM PC/XT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT) for [MiSTer FPGA](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/)

PCXT port for MiSTer by [@spark2k06](https://github.com/spark2k06/).

Discussion and evolution of the core in the following misterfpga forum thread:

https://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?t=4680&start=1020

## Description

The purpose of this core is to implement a PCXT as reliable as possible. For this purpose, the [MCL86 core](https://github.com/MicroCoreLabs/Projects/tree/master/MCL86) from [@MicroCoreLabs](https://github.com/MicroCoreLabs/) and [KFPC-XT](https://github.com/kitune-san/KFPC-XT) from [@kitune-san](https://github.com/kitune-san) are used.

The [Graphics Gremlin project](https://github.com/schlae/graphics-gremlin) from TubeTimeUS ([@schlae](https://github.com/schlae)) has also been integrated in this first stage.

[JTOPL](https://github.com/jotego/jtopl) by Jose Tejada (@topapate) was integrated for AdLib sound.

An SN76489AN Compatible Implementation (Tandy Sound) written in VHDL was also integrated - Copyright (c) 2005, 2006, [Arnim Laeuger](https://github.com/devsaurus) (arnim.laeuger@gmx.net)

## Key features

* Support for Tandy 1000
* Support for IBM PCXT 5160 and clones
* CPU Speed 4.77 MHz and turbo modes 7.16 MHz / 14.318 MHz
* Video modes: 
  * Tandy 320x200x16 graphics 128 kB VRAM (not available on all ports due to BRAM resources)
  * CGA graphics 32kB VRAM (VGA or Composite)
  * MDA monochrome 

* Compatible BIOS selection (IBM5160, Yuko ST, pcxt31, Tandy, micro8088, XT-IDE, ...)
* Main memory 640Kb + 384Kb UMB memory
* EMS memory up to 2Mb
* Audio: Adlib, Tandy, speaker
* Joystick support
* Mouse support into COM2 serial port, this works like any Microsoft mouse... you just need a driver to configure it, like CTMOUSE 1.9 (available into hdd folder), with the command CTMOUSE /s2 

## Quick Start

* Download and uncompress [hd_image.zip](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/PCXT_MiSTer/raw/main/games/PCXT/hd_image.zip)  on your host system. It contains a [freedos](http://www.freedos.org/ ) image
* Load OS with [Serdrive](SW/ ) as explained before
* Prepare an SD card for your FPGA with a PCXT folder containing the BIOS  (see ROM instructions below)
* Upload bitstream into your FPGA (check release in each FPGA folder)
* Press F12 on your keyboard to access the OSD and select options below
  * Model: IBM PCXT
  * CPU Speed: choose 14.318MHz for fastest turbo speed
  * BIOS > PCXT BIOS > browse to the SD folder and choose  pcxt_micro8088.rom or any other ROM
* NOTE: If you leave a BIOS file with the name PCXT.ROM into the root of the SD card it will be loaded straight away after the splash screen. Also you can prepare the other two roms on the SD card:
  * PCXT.ROM  for the IBM PCXT model
  * TANDY.ROM for the TANDY 1000 model
  * XTIDE.ROM for the EC00 BIOS needed to load the OS for Tandy and some PCXT BIOS


## ROM Instructions

ROMs should be provided initially from the BIOS section of the OSD menu, then it is only necessary to indicate the computer model and reset, on subsequent boot of the core, it is no longer necessary to provide them, unless we want to use others. Original and copyrighted ROMs can be generated on the fly using the python scripts available in the SW folder of this repository:

* `make_rom_with_ibm5160.py`: A valid ROM is created for the PCXT model (pcxt.rom) based on the original IBM 5160 ROM, requires the XTIDE BIOS at address EC00h to work with HD images.
* `make_rom_with_jukost.py`: A valid ROM is created for the PCXT model (pcxt.rom) based on the original Juko ST ROM, and with the XTIDE BIOS embedded at address F000h.
* `make_rom_with_tandy.py`: A valid ROM is created for the Tandy model (tandy.rom) based on the original Tandy 1000 ROM, requires the XTIDE BIOS at address EC00h to work with HD images.

From the same BIOS section of the OSD it is possible to specify an XTIDE ROM of up to 16Kb to work at address EC00h. It is also provided in this repository.

Other Open Source ROMs are available in the same folder:

* `pcxt_pcxt31.rom`: This ROM already has the XTIDE BIOS embedded at address F000h. ([Source Code](https://github.com/virtualxt/pcxtbios))
* `pcxt_micro8088.rom`: This ROM already has the XTIDE BIOS embedded at address F000h. ([Source Code](https://github.com/skiselev/8088_bios))
* `ide_xtl.rom`: This ROM corresponds to the XTIDE BIOS, it must be maintained for some scripts to work, it can also be upgraded to a newer version. ([Source Code](https://www.xtideuniversalbios.org/))

NOTES:

* ROMs working with MDA video: (IBM5160, Yuko ST and pcxt31 work), (Tandy, micro8088, full XTIDE BIOS do not work).

* IBM5160 BIOS: Starting BIOS at 14 MHz, lights start blinking and keyboard doesn't work anymore. Starting BIOS at 4.77 MHz and changing it thereafter during the RAM test to 14.3 MHz it lets work in this BIOS without keyboard problems.

## Mounting the disk image

Initially, and until an 8-bit IDE module compatible with XTIDE is available, floppy and hdd mounting will be done through the serial port available in the core via the OSD menu. The available transfer speeds are as follows:

* 115200 Kbps
* 230400 Kbps
* 460800 Kbps
* 921600 Kbps (Only works with CPU speed at 14.318MHz)

By default it is set to 115200, but the most suitable speed is 460800. It is also possible to use 921600, but only with the CPU speed at 14.318MHz.

The floppy disk image is recognised by XTIDE as B: in all BIOSes except JukoST, so to boot from the floppy disk, press the 'B' key when the XTIDE boot screen appears. Mounting and unmounting of such a drive becomes effective after a BIOS reset. Floppy swapping is possible as long as the drive was previously mounted.

The serial port speed change becomes effective after a BIOS reset, it is not possible to use the HDD or Floppy drive after a speed change, the BIOS must always be reset after that.

## To-do list and challenges

* 8-bit IDE module implementation
* Floppy implementation

## Developers
